# ElixirDiscord

A template of a `plug` and `nostrum` application provides a discord bot and a webpage with the Discord bot link that can be deployed to Heroku directly.

## Setup

If you have `asdf`, just run `bin/setup`. After that, you can run `bin/rename` to change the name and base module of the application.

## Development

`bin/server` should start the development server, both the web page and Discord bot. Make sure you have a `.envrc` file like the `.envrc.sample`.

You can check the website at `localhost:4000`.
